# Four OOP principles:

# Encapsulation:
-  Refers to bundling data with methods that can operate on that data within a class.
- Itâ€™s the idea of hiding data within  a class, preventing anything outside that class directly interacting with it.
- Keeps the programmer in control of access to data.
- Prevents the programmer from ending up in any strange or unwanted states.

# Abstraction:
       * Refers to the idea to only showing essential details and keeping everything else hidden.
       * The classes you create should act like your car. Users of your classes should not worry 
       about the inner details of those classes.
       * This is very important when working on your program incrementally.
       
# Inheritance:
- Is the principle that allows classes to derive from other classes.

# Polymorphism:
- Describes methods that are able to take on many forms.
- Allows methods to take on many different forms.
- Be sure that you are calling the correct form of the method.

# There are two types of polymorphism: 

# Dynamic polymorphism: 	
- Occurs during the runtime of the program.
- Describes when a method signature is in both subclass and a superclass.
- The methods share the same name but have different implementation.
- The implementation of the subclass that the object is an instance of overrides that of the superclass.
              
# Static polymorphism:
-  Occurs during compile-time rather than during runtime.
-  Refers to when multiply methods with the same name but different arguments are defined in the same class.
-  The parameters are different type or taken in different order.
-  This is known as method overloading.
